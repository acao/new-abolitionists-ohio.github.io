All data generated by body cams shall fall solely under the jurisdiction of the newly elected Civilian Review Board. To ensure the privacy and protection of both parties, no third party entities or the Cleveland Division of Police shall have access to said data without the express permission of the Civilian Review Board. We demand that the Civilian Review Board take into account ACLU protocol regarding body camera data and its perpetual existence over time. Residents have reported a lack of transparency and urgency in handling of complaints. These ignored complaints support an environment that allows corruption to continue. We necessitate a premium standard of transparency and accountability from the Cleveland Division of Police and its subsidiaries.
