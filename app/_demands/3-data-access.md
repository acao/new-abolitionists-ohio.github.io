title:  "3: Access to Data"
---
All data generated by body cameras shall fall solely under the jurisdiction of the newly elected Civilian Review Board. To ensure the privacy and protection of both parties, no third party entities or the Cleveland Police Department shall have access to said data without the express permission of the Civilian Review Board. We demand the Civilian Review Board take into account ACLU protocol regarding body camera data and its perpetual existence over time. Residents have reported a lack of transparency and urgency in the handling of complaints. These ignored complaints support an environment which allows for corruption to continue. We necessitate a premium standard of transparency and accountability from the Cleveland Police Department and its subsidiaries.
