title:  "2: Creation of a Civilian Police Review Board"
---
 We demand and require the abolition of internal Cleveland Police Department investigations process along with the current Civilian Police Review Board and establish, out of dire necessity, a democratically elected Civilian Review Board. The elected Civilian Review Board must be linked to currently policed communities with concerns that continue to go ignored. All complaints filed in relation to police actions will be directly handled by the Civilian Review Board. The Civilian Review Board will also be able to launch investigations outside of the complaint process and will hold the power of direct disciplinary action. Cities such as Denver, Colorado and Cincinnati, Ohio have paved the way in this process, and we demand that the City Council act on the demands of the people to address long ignored concerns of violence, racism, and corruption in our community at the hands of the Cleveland Police Department.
