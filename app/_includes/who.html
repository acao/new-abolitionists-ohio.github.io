<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We, as a collective body of concerned families, businesses, organizations and citizenry have formed a strategic campaign to respond to the violence that we are currently experiencing in our communities. Weâ€™ve attended public meetings, vigils and rallies, and talked to family and community members, as well as community leaders. After listening carefully, we have formulated a very specific list of policy and operational change demands that answer a call for justice and better community engagement that has been heard from every corner of Cleveland.</p>
<p>We demand accountability and immediate policy reform by the City of Cleveland. We're here because the city of Cleveland has lost its legitimacy to govern while our people are being murdered in the streets by the police department. The truth is that the deaths of Tanisha Anderson and Tamir Rice are not accidents, not the tragic mistakes of a few 'bad apples', but the extreme manifestation of a racist system that has no accountability.</p>
