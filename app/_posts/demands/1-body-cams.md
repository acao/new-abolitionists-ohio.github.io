As promised by Chief Calvin Williams at the November 25th 2014 community action meeting, we demand the immediate implementation of body cameras in their utter and complete capacity by January 25, 2014. We understand that the city has a budget for roll out and implementation of these accountability tools. Each active patrol officer capable of enforcing the law and exercising deadly force against the residents of this city shall wear a camera equipped with audio and visual capabilities on their person for the full duration of their shift without exception. The continued instances of violence by the police, and the conflicting reports which detail excessive and deadly force, force the people to demand accountability which cannot be altered of reflective of systemic or personal police prejudice. The police body camera program implemented February 2012 in Rialto, CA has already improved police/community relations.
